This addon makes most of the hostile mobs on the overworld and nether dimensions almost indestructible and incredibly difficult to deal with. It's mainly the fact that they are much faster which turns everything into a greater challenge, but if that wasn't enough, they also have much more powerful attacks. For example, most of the mobs cause twice as much damage.

## Info

[Terms of Use](https://nekorosys.github.io/docs/terms_of_use/)

**Current Version** - 1.1.2, <a href="https://mcpedl.com/hardcore-mobs-addon" target="_blank">View at MCPEDL</a>

<br>

### Features

#### How does it work?

**It is recommended NOT to enable this behavior pack on your important worlds, unless there is a recent back-up for them.**<br>

<br>
#### Which mobs have been changed?

The creeper is probably the most dangerous mob seeing as it is super fast and causes a huge fire explosion. The only way that you might survive is if you're equipped with some armor, but even then the odds are quite low that you'll survive. 

_Here is list of changes for most hostile mobs in the game. You can try the add-on for yourself if you want to know which mobs were also modified._

-     **Husk** - Inflicts poisonous damage. Twice as much health and attack damage. Also much faster.<br>
-     **Evoker** - Summons Vindicators instead of Vex. It has double health.<br>
-     **Zombie** - Twice as much health and attack damage.<br>
-     **Skeleton** - Very fast, double health and attack damage.<br>
-     **Spiders** - Increased speed and agility.

<br>

## Planned Features

-     _More hostile mobs to buff._
-     _Better loot tables._
-     _Modified UI to display a new "Hardcore Mobs" difficulty that OPs can select for their worlds._
