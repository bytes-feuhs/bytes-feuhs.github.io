Hello there, I am NeKoRoSYS! You can call me Nekoro or Necro for short, or even Marky, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am an aspiring graphic designer and game developer. I created this website for the sole purpose of providing a personal space for myself and my creations, that anyone interested can see!

It'd be really appreciated if you support me by <a href="{{ site.kofi }}" target="_blank">buying me a cup of coffee</a>. This will help motivate myself to do better, provide services of better quality, and achieve goals from further beyond! (っ＾▿＾)っ
